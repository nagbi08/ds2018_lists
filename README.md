# Lists

## Task

In this assignment you will program two different list data structures. A doubly-linked list and a skip list. The doubly-linked list serves as a warm-up to the skip list exercise. Both of those data structures must be programmed as class templates and follow the C++ STL convention of accessing and manipulating elements. You will have to use dynamic memory management.

## Data structures to program

The classes you are about to program are class templates. The whole code for them lives in the header files.

### List

~~~cpp
void main(){

}
